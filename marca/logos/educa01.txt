#Prompt:

Imagem An abstract logo for a brand named "educAI", which optimizes teachers' workflow using AI. The logo is a single, continuous line that starts as a chaotic, tangled shape on the left and smoothly transitions into a perfectly ordered, simple geometric shape on the right. The line glows with a gradient from a soft purple to a bright teal. The style is ultra-minimalist, sophisticated, and conceptual. Displayed on a dark gray background, graphic design, high resolution. --ar 16:9 --chaos 10


#Pensamento da IA:

Analyzing the Request

I'm focusing on the user's detailed description for image generation. It seems the core request centers around producing an image that matches specific content, style, and aspect ratio parameters provided by the user. I'm prioritizing understanding how to best interpret and utilize these inputs for generating the desired image.

Interpreting User Input

I've determined that the user's detailed description translates directly into a prompt for image generation. The core request is clear, and I'm currently structuring the input for the image generation tool. I'm focusing on extracting the crucial elements: content, style, and aspect ratio, to ensure an accurate and relevant image. The prompt is: "An abstract logo for a brand named 'educAI', which optimizes teachers' workflow using AI. The logo is a single, continuous line that starts as a chaotic, tangled shape on the left and smoothly transitions into a perfectly ordered, simple geometric shape on the right. The line glows with a gradient from a soft purple to a bright teal. The style is ultra-minimal." and I will also add the aspect ratio from the user's input.

Defining the Parameters

I've finalized the prompt structure. I've incorporated the user's detailed description, focusing on key elements like content, style, and aspect ratio. Now I'm ready to use image_generation.generate_images with the following parameters: prompts is the user's detailed description with added details; image_generation_usecase is set to ALTERNATIVES; and aspect_ratio is correctly set as ASPECT_RATIO_16_9 from the input --ar 16:9.
